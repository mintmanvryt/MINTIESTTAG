Thanks for choosing Advanced Playfab!

There are some scripts inside Scripts that you can use, DO NOT TOUCH THE ADVANCEDPLAYFAB SCRIPT!!!

Here are some instructions:


1. Drag the Advanced Playfab Prefab into the Hierarchy
2. For CurrencyKey, put in the Currency Code that you put into Playfab under Economy > Currency (Legacy)
3. For Catalog, just put in your catalogs name located in Playfab under Economy > Catalogs (Legacy)
4. For CurrencyText, put in a TextMeshPro game object
5. For EnableItems, put under your special items, such as Moderator Cosmetics
6. For DisableItems, you can put like a mod door, so if the player has the mod door in Playfab, it will be disabled on start
7. For BannedItems, put the items you want to be enabled on ban, for example, a red cube
8. For BanTime and BanReason, well you already know, just put in 2 textmeshpros
9. For NamingPC, put in the NameScript for your Naming Computer (since this is ment for Gtag Fangames, you will need to modify the script if needed)

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PROBUILDER IMPORTED ASWELL AS TEXTMESHPRO
